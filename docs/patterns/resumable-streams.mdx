title: Resumable Streams
description: Continue AI responses after connection interruptions

<Note>
  This documentation is coming soon. The pattern is implemented in the starter app.

## Problem

Users lose AI responses when their connection drops mid-stream.

## Solution

Store stream chunks in Redis and allow clients to reconnect and resume from where they left off.

## Quick Start

Resumable streams require Redis. Set the environment variable:

```bash
REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
```

No config toggle needed—streams are automatically resumable when Redis is configured.
