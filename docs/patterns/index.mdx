Patterns are battle-tested implementations for complex AI chat features. Each pattern documents the backend, network, and frontend layers with real code from ChatJS.

## Available Patterns

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Tool Part" icon="wrench" href="/patterns/tool-part">
    Define a backend tool, stream results over the network, render a custom UI
    component.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Follow-up Questions"
    icon="message-question"
    href="/patterns/follow-up-questions"
  >
    Generate contextual follow-up suggestions, display only on the last message,
    exclude from LLM context.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Using Patterns

Patterns are designed to be copy-paste ready. Each includes:

1. **Problem** — What pain this solves
2. **Solution** — High-level approach
3. **Implementation** — Code for each layer
4. **Key Files** — Where to find the code in ChatJS
