## Problem

Users want to explore different conversation directions without losing context.

## Solution

Implement a tree structure for messages with parent references, allowing users to branch off at any point.

## Implementation Overview

1. **Data Model**: Messages store `parentId` for tree structure
2. **Navigation**: UI for switching between branches
3. **Context**: Proper history construction when loading branches
