Canvas lets you create and edit documents directly in chat. You can generate text documents, code files, and spreadsheets that the AI helps you refine.

## Canvas Types

You can create three types of canvas:

| Type      | Best for                                                     | Features                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Text**  | Essays, emails, reports, and other written content           | AI suggestions, edit tracking, version history          |
| **Code**  | Python scripts, JavaScript, TypeScript, and other code files | Syntax highlighting, execution support, version history |
| **Sheet** | Spreadsheets, data tables, and CSV files                     | Cell editing, formula support, data manipulation        |

## Creating a Canvas

When you ask the AI to create something substantial, it automatically uses the appropriate canvas type. You can also request specific types:

- **Text documents**: "Write a professional email about..." or "Draft an essay on..."
- **Code**: "Create a Python script that..." or "Write a React component for..."
- **Spreadsheets**: "Create a spreadsheet with..." or "Build a data table for..."

The AI decides whether to create a canvas based on content length and type. Short responses stay in chat, while substantial content gets its own canvas.

## Editing Documents

### Making Changes

You can edit any canvas you create. Click into the canvas to edit directly, or ask the AI to make specific changes:

- "Make this code more concise"
- "Fix the typos in this email"
- "Add a column for timestamps"

The AI can update the entire document or make targeted edits based on your instructions.

### Version History

Your canvas maintains a version history. You can navigate between versions using the version controls:

- View previous versions
- Compare changes between versions
- Revert to an earlier version if needed

### Suggestions (Text Documents Only)

Text canvas shows AI-powered suggestions for improvements. You can accept or dismiss suggestions individually. This helps you refine your writing without rewriting from scratch.

## Tips for Better Results

### For Text Documents

- Be specific about tone and audience ("professional email to a manager")
- Ask for specific improvements ("tighten the introduction" or "add more examples")
- Use suggestions to iterate rather than rewriting

### For Code Canvas

- Include the file extension in your request ("Write a `script.py`" or "Create `utils.ts`")
- Specify the programming language if not obvious
- Ask for specific refactors ("add error handling" or "make it more efficient")

### For Spreadsheets

- Describe the data structure clearly ("rows for employees, columns for name, email, department")
- Specify any calculations or formulas you need
- You can edit cells directly or ask the AI to make bulk changes

## Configuration

Canvas is built into the chat interface. No additional configuration is required.
