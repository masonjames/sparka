## Overview

Projects help you organize related conversations and apply custom instructions across multiple chats. When you create a chat within a project, it automatically applies the project's instructions to shape the AI's behavior for that workspace.

## Creating a project

You can create a new project from the sidebar:

1. In the left sidebar, click "New project"
2. Enter a project name
3. Click "Create"

Your new project appears in the sidebar and is ready to use.

## Setting project instructions

Project instructions customize the AI's behavior for all chats in that project. You can set instructions after creating a project:

1. Navigate to your project by clicking its name in the sidebar
2. On the project home page, click the "Instructions" button
3. Enter your instructions in the dialog
4. Click "Save instructions"

Your instructions automatically apply to all new messages in chats within this project. The AI sees them as additional context appended to its system prompt.

## Managing projects

From the project dropdown menu in the sidebar, you can:

- **Rename** your project to better reflect its purpose
- **Delete** the project (this removes the project, but your chats remain)

Click the more menu (three dots) next to a project name to access these options.

## Using projects in conversations

When you create a new chat from a project, that chat is automatically linked to the project. The project's instructions apply immediately and consistently across all conversations you have within it.

You can switch between projects by clicking different project names in the sidebar. Each project maintains its own set of chats and instructions.

## Advanced usage

### Multiple projects for different contexts

Create separate projects for different use cases. For example:

- One project for writing tasks with specific style guidelines
- Another for code reviews with technical instructions
- A third for creative work with artistic direction

Each project keeps its conversations isolated and applies its own custom instructions.

### Updating instructions over time

As your needs change, you can edit project instructions anytime. The updated instructions apply to new messages only. Existing chat history remains unchanged.

### Organizing by team or domain

Projects work well for organizing conversations by team, client, or subject matter. Keep conversations grouped logically so your instructions stay relevant to each project's purpose.
