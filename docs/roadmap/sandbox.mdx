title: Code Execution
description: Run code in a secure Vercel Sandbox environment
---

<Note>
  This documentation is coming soon. The feature is implemented using Vercel Sandbox.
</Note>

## Overview

Execute code snippets directly in chat using Vercel's secure sandbox environment. The AI can run Python, JavaScript, and other languages to solve problems, analyze data, or demonstrate concepts.

## How It Works

1. The AI generates code based on your request
2. Code is sent to Vercel Sandbox for execution
3. Results (output, errors, generated files) stream back to the chat
4. You can iterate on the code with follow-up messages

## Supported Languages

- Python (with common data science libraries)
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Additional languages based on Vercel Sandbox support

## Configuration

Enable code execution in `lib/config.ts`:

```ts
integrations: {
  codeExecution: true,
}
```

## Security

Code runs in an isolated Vercel Sandbox environment with:

- No access to your local filesystem
- Network restrictions
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, execution time)
- Automatic cleanup after execution
