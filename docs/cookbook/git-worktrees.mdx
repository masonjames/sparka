## Problem

Switching branches interrupts your workflow. You lose editor state, need to reinstall dependencies, and can't easily compare implementations side-by-side. Working on multiple features or reviewing PRs requires constant context switching.

## Solution

Git worktrees create separate working directories for different branches, all sharing the same repository. Each worktree has its own files, node_modules, and environment—letting you work on multiple branches simultaneously.

## Implementation

### Setup Script

Create a setup script that initializes worktrees with dependencies and environment files:

```bash title="scripts/worktree-setup.sh"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Setup a worktree with .env.local and deps
# Usage: worktree-setup.sh [branch-name]
#   No args: setup current worktree
#   With arg: create worktree + setup
set -e

MAIN_REPO=$(git worktree list | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
REPO_NAME=$(basename "$MAIN_REPO")

if [ -n "$1" ]; then
  WORKTREE_PATH="../$REPO_NAME-$1"
  git worktree add -b "$1" "$WORKTREE_PATH" 2>/dev/null || git worktree add "$WORKTREE_PATH" "$1"
  cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"
fi

cp "$MAIN_REPO/.env.local" .env.local 2>/dev/null && echo "✓ .env.local" || echo "⚠ No .env.local"
bun i
echo "✓ Ready: $(pwd)"
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/worktree-setup.sh
```

### IDE Integration (Cursor)

For Cursor IDE, add automatic dependency installation when opening worktrees:

```json title=".cursor/worktrees.json"
{
  "setup-worktree": ["bun install"]
}
```

### Git Aliases

Add these to your `~/.gitconfig` for faster worktree commands:

```ini title="~/.gitconfig"
[alias]
    # List all worktrees
    wtl = worktree list

    # Add a new worktree (usage: git wta <branch-name>)
    wta = "!f() { git worktree add -b \"$1\" \"../$1\"; }; f"

    # Remove a worktree (usage: git wtr <path>)
    wtr = "!git worktree remove \"$@\" #"

    # Prune stale worktrees
    wtp = worktree prune

    # Cleanup merged branches and their worktrees
    wt-cleanup = "!f() { git fetch -p && git branch --merged ${1:-main} | grep -v \"^[* ]*${1:-main}$\" | while read branch; do wt=$(git worktree list | grep \"\\[$branch\\]\" | awk '{print $1}'); [ -n \"$wt\" ] && git worktree remove \"$wt\"; git branch -d \"$branch\"; done }; f"
```

## Usage

### Create a New Worktree

```bash
# Create worktree for a new branch
./scripts/worktree-setup.sh feature-auth

# Or use git alias
git wta feature-auth
```

This creates `../chatjs-feature-auth/` with:
- Fresh checkout of the branch
- Copied `.env.local` from main repo
- Installed dependencies

### Setup Existing Worktree

```bash
# In the worktree directory, run without args
./scripts/worktree-setup.sh
```

### List Worktrees

```bash
git worktree list
# /home/user/chatjs              abc1234 [main]
# /home/user/chatjs-feature-auth def5678 [feature-auth]
```

### Remove Worktree

```bash
# Remove worktree (keeps branch)
git worktree remove ../chatjs-feature-auth

# Force remove if there are changes
git worktree remove --force ../chatjs-feature-auth
```
