description: "Access hundreds of AI models through OpenRouter"
---

The OpenRouter gateway connects ChatJS to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai), a unified API that routes to hundreds of models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral, and many others.

Use this gateway when you want an alternative to Vercel AI Gateway or need access to models not available through Vercel.

## Setup

1. Create an account at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)
2. Go to [API Keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys) and create a key
3. Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
```

4. Set the gateway in your config:

```typescript title="chat.config.ts"
const config: ConfigInput = {
  gateway: "openrouter",
  // ...
};
```

## Authentication

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Required. Your OpenRouter API key |

Without the key, the app falls back to the static model snapshot in `models.generated.ts` and cannot make API calls.

## Available models

OpenRouter provides access to hundreds of models. The full list is fetched at runtime from `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` and cached for 1 hour.

The OpenRouter response format is automatically normalized to match the internal `AiGatewayModel` schema. This includes:

- `context_length` mapped to `context_window`
- `pricing.prompt` / `pricing.completion` mapped to `pricing.input` / `pricing.output`
- Tags derived from `architecture.input_modalities`, `architecture.output_modalities`, and `supported_parameters` (vision, reasoning, tool-use, image-generation, etc.)

## Model IDs

Model IDs use the same `provider/model` format as Vercel AI Gateway. For example:

- `openai/gpt-4o`
- `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`
- `google/gemini-2.5-flash`
- `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick`

Your existing model configuration in `chat.config.ts` works across both gateways as long as the model IDs match. Check [OpenRouter Models](https://openrouter.ai/models) for the full list of available IDs.

## Image generation

OpenRouter routes image generation through multimodal language models rather than dedicated image APIs. `createImageModel()` returns `null` for this gateway.

Models with the `image-generation` tag (those with `image` in their output modalities) can still generate images inline through `createLanguageModel()`. The existing [Image Generation](/features/image-generation) feature handles this automatically.

## Pricing

OpenRouter charges per-token based on the underlying model's pricing. Check [OpenRouter Pricing](https://openrouter.ai/models) for current rates.

You can set spending limits in your [OpenRouter dashboard](https://openrouter.ai/settings/limits).
