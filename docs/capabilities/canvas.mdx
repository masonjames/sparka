Canvas lets you create and edit documents directly in chat. You can generate text documents, code files, and spreadsheets that the AI helps you refine.

## Canvas Types

You can create three types of canvas:

| Type      | Best for                                                     | Features                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Text**  | Essays, emails, reports, and other written content           | AI suggestions, diff view, version history, direct editing      |
| **Code**  | Python scripts, JavaScript, TypeScript, and other code files | Syntax highlighting, Python execution, version history          |
| **Sheet** | Spreadsheets, data tables, and CSV files                     | Cell editing, CSV export, data visualization via Python         |

## Creating a Canvas

When you ask the AI to create something substantial, it automatically uses the appropriate canvas type. You can also request specific types:

- **Text documents**: "Write a professional email about..." or "Draft an essay on..."
- **Code**: "Create a Python script that..." or "Write a React component for..."
- **Spreadsheets**: "Create a spreadsheet with..." or "Build a data table for..."

The AI decides whether to create a canvas based on content length and type. Short responses stay in chat, while substantial content gets its own canvas.

## Editing Documents

### Making Changes

You can edit any canvas you create. Click into the canvas to edit directly, or ask the AI to make specific changes:

- "Make this code more concise"
- "Fix the typos in this email"
- "Add a column for timestamps"

The AI can update the entire document or make targeted edits based on your instructions.

### Version History

Your canvas maintains a version history. You can navigate between versions using the arrow controls in the canvas header:

- Navigate to previous versions
- Navigate to next versions
- Return to the latest version when viewing an older one

### Diff View (Text Documents Only)

Text canvas supports a diff view that shows exactly what changed between consecutive versions. Toggle the diff view to see additions and deletions highlighted.

### Suggestions (Text Documents Only)

Text canvas shows AI-powered suggestions for improvements. You can request suggestions using the toolbar button, and then accept or dismiss them individually. This helps you refine your writing without rewriting from scratch.

## Configuration

Canvas is built into the chat interface. No additional configuration is required.
