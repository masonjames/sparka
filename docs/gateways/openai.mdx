The OpenAI gateway connects ChatJS directly to the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) using the `@ai-sdk/openai` provider SDK. Use this when you only need OpenAI models and want the simplest setup with type-safe model IDs.

## Setup

1. Get an API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

3. Set the gateway in your config:

```typescript title="chat.config.ts"
const config: ConfigInput = {
  models: {
    gateway: "openai",
    defaults: {
      chat: "gpt-5-mini",
      title: "gpt-5-nano",
      // ...
    },
    // ...
  },
};
```

## Authentication

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Required. Your OpenAI API key |

Without the key, the app falls back to the static model snapshot in `models.generated.ts` and cannot make API calls.

## Available Models

Models are fetched at runtime from `https://api.openai.com/v1/models` and cached for 1 hour. This returns all models available to your API key, including GPT, DALL-E, and embedding models.

## Model IDs

Unlike the Vercel and OpenRouter gateways which use `provider/model` format, the OpenAI gateway uses bare model IDs since all models come from OpenAI:

- `gpt-5-mini`
- `gpt-5-nano`
- `gpt-4o`
- `o3-mini`

The gateway provides **type-safe model IDs** extracted from the `@ai-sdk/openai` SDK, giving you autocomplete in `chat.config.ts`.

## Image Generation

The OpenAI gateway supports dedicated image models through `createImageModel()`:

- `gpt-image-1`
- `gpt-image-1.5`
- `dall-e-3`

This enables the built-in [Image Generation](/features/image-generation) feature.
