## Overview

Customize how your AI assistant behaves by modifying system prompts.

## Quick Start

Edit the system prompt in `lib/ai/prompts.ts`:

```ts
export const systemPrompt = `You are a helpful assistant...`
```

## Per-Project Prompts

When projects are enabled, users can set custom instructions per project that get appended to the system prompt.
