## Overview

Customize how your AI assistant behaves by modifying system prompts in `lib/ai/prompts.ts`.

## System Prompt

The main system prompt defines your assistant's personality, capabilities, and response format:

```ts
export const systemPrompt = () => `You are a friendly assistant!

## Your Goals
- Stay concious and aware of the guidelines.
- Stay efficient and focused on the user's needs, do not take extra steps.
- Provide accurate, concise, and well-formatted responses.
- Avoid hallucinations or fabrications. Stick to verified facts and provide proper citations.
- Follow formatting guidelines strictly.
- Markdown is supported in the response and you can use it to format the response.
- Do not use $ for currency, use USD instead always.

## Content Rules:
  - Responses must be informative, long and very detailed which address the question's answer straight forward instead of taking it to the conclusion.
  - Use structured answers with markdown format and tables too.
  - If a diagram is needed, return it in a fenced mermaid code block.

### Citation rules:
- Insert citation right after the relevant sentence/paragraph — not in a footer
- Format exactly: [Source Title](URL)
- Cite only the most relevant hits and avoid fluff

Today's Date: ${new Date().toLocaleDateString("en-US", {
  year: "numeric",
  month: "short",
  day: "2-digit",
  weekday: "short",
})}
`;
```

The prompt is a function so dynamic values like the current date can be injected.

## Artifact Prompts

Separate prompts control artifact generation for different types:

### Code Prompt

Used when generating Python code snippets:

```ts
export const codePrompt = `
You are a Python code generator that creates self-contained, executable code snippets. When writing code:

1. Each snippet should be complete and runnable on its own
2. Prefer using print() statements to display outputs
3. Include helpful comments explaining the code
4. Keep snippets concise (generally under 15 lines)
5. Avoid external dependencies - use Python standard library
6. Handle potential errors gracefully
7. Return meaningful output that demonstrates the code's functionality
8. Don't use input() or other interactive functions
9. Don't access files or network resources
10. Don't use infinite loops
`;
```

### Sheet Prompt

Used when generating spreadsheets:

```ts
export const sheetPrompt = `
You are a spreadsheet creation assistant. Create a spreadsheet in csv format based on the given prompt. The spreadsheet should contain meaningful column headers and data.

IMPORTANT CSV FORMATTING RULES:
1. NEVER use commas (,) within cell contents as they will break the CSV format
2. For numbers over 999, do not use any thousand separators (write as: 10000 not 10,000)
3. Use semicolons (;) or spaces to separate multiple items in a cell
`;
```

### Update Document Prompt

Used when updating existing artifacts:

```ts
export const updateDocumentPrompt = (
  currentContent: string | null,
  type: ArtifactKind
) => {
  if (type === "text") {
    return `Improve the following contents of the document based on the given prompt.\n\n${currentContent}`;
  }
  if (type === "code") {
    return `Improve the following code snippet based on the given prompt.\n\n${currentContent}`;
  }
  if (type === "sheet") {
    return `Improve the following spreadsheet based on the given prompt.\n\n${currentContent}`;
  }
  return "";
};
```

## Per-Project Prompts

When projects are enabled, users can set custom instructions per project that get appended to the system prompt. This allows different behavior for different use cases without modifying the base prompt.

## Best Practices

- Keep prompts focused and specific
- Include examples of desired output format when relevant
- Test changes with various inputs to ensure consistent behavior
- Use functions for prompts that need dynamic values
