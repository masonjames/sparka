## Overview

Configure which AI models are available in your app and how they behave.

## Quick Start

Models are configured via AI Gateway. The available providers are listed in `lib/config.ts`:

```ts
services: {
  aiProviders: [
    "OpenAI", "Anthropic", "xAI", "Google", "Meta",
    "Mistral", "Alibaba", "Amazon", "Cohere", "DeepSeek",
    "Perplexity", "Vercel", "Inception", "Moonshot", "Morph", "ZAI",
  ],
}
```

Model selection and configuration is handled through the Vercel AI Gateway.
