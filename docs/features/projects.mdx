description: Organize chats and set custom instructions with icon and color customization
---

## Overview

Projects help you organize related conversations and apply custom instructions across multiple chats. When you create a chat within a project, it automatically applies the project's instructions to shape the AI's behavior for that workspace.

Each project has:

- A **name** to identify the workspace
- An optional **icon** (from a curated set of Lucide icons) and **color** to visually distinguish it
- Optional **instructions** that are appended to the system prompt for every chat in the project

## Creating a project

1. In the left sidebar, click "New project"
2. Enter a project name
3. Optionally pick an icon and color
4. Click "Create"

Your new project appears in the sidebar and is ready to use.

## Setting project instructions

Project instructions customize the AI's behavior for all chats in that project:

1. Navigate to your project by clicking its name in the sidebar
2. On the project home page, click the "Instructions" button
3. Enter your instructions in the dialog
4. Click "Save instructions"

Instructions are appended to the system prompt server-side whenever a new message is sent in a chat that belongs to the project. Existing chat history remains unchanged.

## Icon and color customization

When creating or editing a project you can choose from 25 icons (folder, briefcase, book, code, rocket, and more) and 9 colors (gray, red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple, pink). Defaults are the folder icon in gray.

The icon and color appear in the sidebar and on the project home page for quick visual identification.

## Managing projects

From the three-dot menu next to a project name in the sidebar you can:

- **Edit** the project name, icon, and color
- **Delete** the project (chats remain, they just lose their project association)

## Routing

Projects introduce dedicated routes:

| Route                              | Description                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/project/:projectId`              | Project home page with a new-chat input and a list of the project's chats |
| `/project/:projectId/chat/:chatId` | A chat that belongs to the project                                        |

The sidebar shows breadcrumb navigation so you can move between the project home and individual chats.

See [URL Routing](/reference/routing) for the complete route table.

## Advanced usage

### Multiple projects for different contexts

Create separate projects for different use cases. For example:

- One project for writing tasks with specific style guidelines
- Another for code reviews with technical instructions
- A third for creative work with artistic direction

### Updating instructions over time

You can edit project instructions anytime. Updated instructions apply to new messages only.
