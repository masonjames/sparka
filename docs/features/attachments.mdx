ChatJS supports file attachments in conversations. Files are uploaded to Vercel Blob storage and processed by AI models that support multimodal input.

## Supported File Types

| Type | Extensions | Processing |
|------|------------|------------|
| Images | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg` | Direct vision input |
| PDFs | `.pdf` | Text extraction |

## How It Works

1. User attaches file in chat input
2. File uploads to Vercel Blob
3. URL/content included in message
4. Model processes based on type

## Configuration

Requires `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` from Vercel Blob:

```bash
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_...
```

On Vercel, this is auto-provided via the Blob integration.

## Model Support

Not all models support attachments. Check `modelDefinition.input` for capability:

```typescript
const modelDefinition = await getAppModelDefinition(modelId);
if (modelDefinition.input) {
  // Model supports file inputs
}
```
