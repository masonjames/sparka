ChatJS supports file attachments in conversations. Files are uploaded to Vercel Blob storage and processed by AI models that support multimodal input.

## Supported File Types

| Type | Extensions | Processing |
|------|------------|------------|
| Images | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.webp` | Direct vision input |
| PDFs | `.pdf` | Text extraction |
| Documents | `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv` | Text content |

## How It Works

1. User attaches file in chat input
2. File uploads to Vercel Blob
3. URL/content included in message
4. Model processes based on type

## Configuration

Requires `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` from Vercel Blob:

```bash
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_...
```

On Vercel, this is auto-provided via the Blob integration.

## Message Structure

Attachments are included in message parts:

```typescript
{
  role: "user",
  parts: [
    { type: "text", text: "What's in this image?" },
    { type: "file", url: "https://...", mimeType: "image/png" }
  ]
}
```

## Model Support

Not all models support attachments. Check `modelDefinition.input` for capability:

```typescript
const modelDefinition = await getAppModelDefinition(modelId);
if (modelDefinition.input) {
  // Model supports file inputs
}
```
