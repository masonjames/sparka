ChatJS uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database access.

## Schema

The database schema is defined in `lib/db/schema.ts`.

## Migrations

Generate and run migrations with:

```bash
# Generate migration from schema changes
bun db:generate

# Run pending migrations
bun db:migrate

# Push schema directly (dev only, no migration file)
bun db:push
```

## Neon Branching

When working on schema changes, use Neon branching to avoid affecting production data. See the [Neon Branching recipe](/cookbook/neon-branching) for setup and usage.

## Drizzle Studio

Inspect your database with Drizzle Studio:

```bash
bun db:studio
```

Opens a web UI at `https://local.drizzle.studio` for browsing and editing data.
