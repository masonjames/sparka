# Repo Context

- Vercel AI SDK for AI framework and frontend-backend interactions
- Next.js with app directory
- ORM is Drizzle with the schema at `lib/db/schema.ts`
- DB queries and mutations are at `lib/db/queries.ts`
- To test your changes through compilation. Don't run a build. But do `bun test:types`
- This repo uses Tailwind 4.
- Shadcn UI is used for the UI components and the components are in `components/ui` folder. The config is in `components.json`.

## App structure

- People interact with the AI through the `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` by sending a message. It responds by creating a new message.

## Database Migrations

- To perform database migrations follow drizzle conventions. First make the desired changes to the schema in `lib/db/schema.ts`. Then run `bun db:generate` to generate the migration file. Then run `bun db:migrate` to apply the migration to the database.

## Environment Variables

- All env vars are managed in `lib/env.ts` using `@t3-oss/env-nextjs`
- Add new vars to the `server` object with zod schema
- Use `env.VAR_NAME` instead of `process.env.VAR_NAME`
- Feature flags live in `lib/config.ts` (integrations, authentication)
- When a feature is enabled in config, its required env vars must be validated in `scripts/check-env.ts`
- Pattern: check `siteConfig.feature && !env.REQUIRED_VAR` then push to errors array

## Browser Testing

- To test authenticated features in the browser, navigate to `/api/dev-login` first
- This creates a dev session and redirects to `/` with valid auth cookies
- Only works in development (`NODE_ENV=development`)
