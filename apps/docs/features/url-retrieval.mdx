title: URL Retrieval
description: Fetch and extract structured content from any URL

## Overview

URL Retrieval lets the AI read the content of a specific URL the user shares in chat. Powered by [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev), it scrapes the page and returns clean markdown — title, description, and body — injected directly into the AI's context.

This is distinct from [Web Search](/features/web-search): URL Retrieval fetches a known URL, while Web Search queries the web to discover relevant pages.

## Quick Start

Enable URL Retrieval in `chat.config.ts`:

```ts
features: {
  urlRetrieval: true, // Requires FIRECRAWL_API_KEY
}
```

Add the API key to your environment:

```bash
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_key
```

## How It Works

When a user pastes a URL into the chat, the AI invokes the `retrieveUrl` tool automatically. The tool:

1. Calls the Firecrawl `scrapeUrl` API on the provided URL
2. Extracts the page title, description, and body as clean markdown
3. Falls back to Firecrawl's `extract` API if any field is missing from the scrape response
4. Returns the structured result into the AI's context

The AI then answers questions or summarizes the page content based on what was retrieved.

<Note>
  URL Retrieval does not stream intermediate results. The AI waits for Firecrawl
  to return content before generating a response.
</Note>

## Usage

Paste any URL directly in the chat message:

> "Summarize https://example.com/article"

> "What does this page say about pricing? https://example.com/pricing"

The AI will read the page and respond based on its content. No special syntax is required — the model invokes the tool when it determines a URL is present and content retrieval is appropriate.

### Tool Output

The tool returns a structured result:

```ts
{
  results: [
    {
      title: "Page Title",
      description: "Brief description from page metadata",
      content: "Full page body as clean markdown...",
      url: "https://example.com/article",
      language: "en",
    },
  ],
}
```

## Configuration

| Setting          | Value                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Config key       | `features.urlRetrieval`        |
| Required env var | `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`            |
| Tool name        | `retrieveUrl`                  |
| Tool file        | `apps/chat/lib/ai/tools/retrieve-url.ts` |

### Customization

The tool description controls when the AI decides to invoke it. Edit `apps/chat/lib/ai/tools/retrieve-url.ts` to adjust:

```ts
description: `Fetch structured information from a single URL via Firecrawl.

Use for:
- Extract content from a specific URL supplied by the user

Avoid:
- General-purpose web searches`,
```
