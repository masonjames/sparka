description: Share conversations publicly and let others view your chats
---

You can share chat conversations with others by making them public. Anyone with the share link can view the chat, and you can toggle visibility back to private at any time.

## How to Share a Chat

1. Open a chat in your workspace
2. Click the **Share** button in the chat header
3. Click **Share Chat** to make the conversation public
4. Copy the share link that appears
5. Send the link to anyone you want to share with

## Viewing a Shared Chat

Anyone with the share link can view the conversation without creating an account. Viewers can read all messages and see generated content, but cannot edit or continue the conversation.

If the chat owner makes the conversation private, the share link will display an error message indicating the chat is no longer available.

## Cloning a Shared Chat

When viewing a shared chat, you can create your own editable copy by clicking **Copy Chat**. This creates a new private chat in your workspace with all messages from the shared conversation. You can then continue or edit the cloned chat independently.

Cloning copies:

- All messages and their content
- Generated documents associated with messages
- File attachments (copied to your storage)

## Managing Visibility

### Making a Chat Private

To stop sharing a chat:

1. Open the chat
2. Click the **Share** button
3. Click **Make Private**

The share link will immediately stop working and return an error to anyone who tries to access it.

### Visibility States

Each chat has one of two visibility settings:

- **Private** (default): Only you can access this chat
- **Public**: Anyone with the link can view the chat in read-only mode

The share dialog displays the current visibility status with a visual indicator.

## Authentication Requirements

- **Sharing**: You must be signed in to share chats. Anonymous users see a prompt to sign in when clicking the Share button.
- **Viewing**: Anyone can view a public chat without signing in.
- **Cloning**: You must be signed in to clone a shared chat to your workspace.

## Use Cases

**Share research or analysis**: Make a detailed conversation public so others can learn from it without recreating the work.

**Showcase capabilities**: Demonstrate what the AI assistant can do by sharing example conversations.

**Collaborate asynchronously**: Share a conversation thread for team members to review and discuss.

**Create templates**: Share useful conversations that others can clone and adapt for their own use.
