ChatJS can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js.

## Getting Started

Follow the [Quickstart](/quickstart) to scaffold your project and get it running locally. Then deploy to your platform of choice.

## Environment Variables

See the [Quickstart](/quickstart#3-configure-environment-variables) for required environment variables.

## Database Migrations

For production deployments, use tracked migrations instead of `db:push`:

```bash
bun run db:migrate
```
