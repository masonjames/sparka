# Package Manager: Bun

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the package manager and runtime.

## Rules

- Always use `bun install` instead of `npm install` or `yarn`
- Always use `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run` or `yarn`
- Use `bun.lock` (not `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`)
- The Dockerfile uses Bun for builds

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run dev server
bun run dev

# Build for production
bun run build

# Run type checking
bun run typecheck

# Run linting
bun run lint
```

## Why Bun?

- Faster dependency installation
- Consistent with upstream (FranciscoMoretti/sparka)
- Native TypeScript support
- Better performance for Next.js builds
