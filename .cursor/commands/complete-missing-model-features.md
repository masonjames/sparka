# Complete Model Features

For all of the models in `lib/models/missing-model-features.json`, search online and add entries to `lib/models/model-features.manual.ts`.

## Rules
- Create a TODO task for each and then search online for each
- If you need the names, they are in `lib/models/models-list.json`
- Never do other edits in `lib/models/model-features.manual.ts` than adding features.

## Task
- Read `lib/models/missing-model-features.json` (these are NEW deltas only)
- Create a TODO task for each of them
- Search online for each task
- Add entries to `lib/models/model-features.manual.ts`
- Run `bun test:types` to check for errors
